# insuranceint

<p>This project is best described as a mock up, responsive user interface for a health insurance eligibility form</p>

The goal of this project, was simply to show how certain events can work, as well as how to create a reasonably responsive design
for different devices. Some Vanilla Javascript was used, as well as a responsive.css file, and a normalize.css to make everything
neutral.
